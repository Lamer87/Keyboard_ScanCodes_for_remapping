## Keyboard ScanCodes for remapping

### This is a simple guide on remapping (rebinding) keyboard keys,  
### whitout using an external tool, just the system registry.
<!-- ### `v1.0` -->

---

You can download all (this readme, the example and the remover) [here](https://github.com/Lamer87/Keyboard_ScanCodes_for_remapping/archive/refs/heads/main.zip),  
or just click on Code then Download ZIP.

You can download just the EXAMPLE file (Rebind.reg) to edit yourself [here]().  
This one is ALREADY modified and will add the necessary "hex" value to the registry,  
so before applying it you have to EDIT IT properly.

If you want to get rid of the remapping, download [this file]() as well (remover.reg),  
this one can be even used to create the empty hex value.

Every time you apply the values, you must AT LEAST logout and login (or restart), for the changes to take effect.

---

How to create the value in the registry whitout the example file:  
1- Open "C:\Windows\regedit.exe"  
2- Go to "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Keyboard Layout" (not Keyboard Layout**S**)  
3- Create a new binary value here, named: "Scancode Map" (without quotes).

What goes inside the binary value is described below, in the regedit file format (so not manually entering via regedit.exe).

---

## Example: ##

```
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Keyboard Layout]
"Scancode Map"=hex:00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,02,00,00,00,3A,00,5D,E0,00,00,00,00
```

What means an entire regedit code:  

| 00,00,00,00, | 00,00,00,00, | 02,00,00,00, | 3A,00,5D,E0, | 00,00,00,00 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1st 8 bits | 2nd 8 bits | 3rd 8 bits | 4th 8 bits | 5th 8 bits
| version | flag | number of rebinds +1! | rebind n1 | final bits (null)

Version: always 8 zeroes  
Flag: always 8 zeroes  

Number of rebinds:  
only the first 2 bits count, the value must be made up of the number of rebinds (8 bits for each one),  
plus one for the final 8 bits (which must always be 8 zeroes).  
For example, if we want to rebind 4 keys, the value number of rebinds will be 05,00,00,00,  
if the rebinds are 12 the value will be 13,00,00,00,

What means rebind n1:  

| 3A,00, | 5D,E0, |
| --- | --- |
| 1st part: it's the keycode of the remapping | 2nd part: the button you actually press

---
What means the single code "5D,EO":  

5D: scancode of the key  
E0: can be 00 or E0 (or E1 for button Pause)  
    some keys share the scancode, changing only the second part

A good tool to show keycodes for your keyboard is [Keyboard Key Info](https://dennisbabkin.com/kbdkeyinfo/)  
it shows what keycode (1st part) are you pressing on the keyboard.  
Example: "ScanCode=0x4F" where the keycode 1st part is "4F" but you don't know if the second part is 00 or E0  
(so I'll help you with the table below :) )

---

In this table, secondary code is always "00" when there are only 2 digits, others are specified.
