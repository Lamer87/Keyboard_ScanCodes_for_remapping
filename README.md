## Keyboard ScanCodes for remapping ‚å®Ô∏è

### This is a simple guide for remapping (rebinding) keyboard keys
### whitout using a tool, just the system registry. `v1.2`

- [**Key ScanCode table**](https://github.com/Lamer87/Keyboard_ScanCodes_for_remapping#-key-scancode-table) (go to)

- ‚ùó Note 1: this is only for changing one key to another, it is NOT possible to map combinations  
(example CTRL+C) to a key, to do this you need a tool.

- üí° Note 2: you can find [other sources](https://github.com/Lamer87/Keyboard_ScanCodes_for_remapping#-other-sources) at the bottom of this page.

---

- üíæ You can download the package (readme, example and remover) [here üíæ](https://github.com/Lamer87/Keyboard_ScanCodes_for_remapping/archive/refs/heads/main.zip),  
or just click on "Code" then "Download ZIP".

  - The EXAMPLE file (Rebind.reg) it's meant to be edited by you.  
This file is ALREADY modified and will add the necessary "hex" value to the registry,  
so before applying it you have to EDIT IT properly.

  - If you want to get rid of the remapping, use the file "remover.reg",  
it can be even used to create just the empty hex value.

  - Every time you apply the values, you must AT LEAST logout and login (or restart), for the changes to take effect.

---

- üìú How to manually create the value in the registry:  
  - 1- Open "C:\Windows\regedit.exe"  
  - 2- Go to "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Keyboard Layout" (not \Keyboard Layout**S**)  
  - 3- Create a new "binary value" here, named "Scancode Map" (without quotes).

- ‚úîÔ∏è What goes inside the binary value is described below in the regedit file format,
so you don't have to manually enter values via regedit.exe, but just modify Rebind.reg then exec it.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Example: ##

```
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Keyboard Layout]
"Scancode Map"=hex:00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,02,00,00,00,3A,00,5D,E0,00,00,00,00
```

What means an entire regedit code:  

| 00,00,00,00, | 00,00,00,00, | 02,00,00,00, | 3A,00,5D,E0, | 00,00,00,00 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1st 8 bits | 2nd 8 bits | 3rd 8 bits | 4th 8 bits | 5th 8 bits
| version | flag | number of rebinds +1! | rebind n1 | final bits (null)

Each pair of zeros is separated by a "," except for the last pair which ends without it.

Version: always 8 zeroes  
Flag: always 8 zeroes  
Final bits: always 8 zeroes

Number of rebinds:  
only the first 2 bits count as a number (examples: 02 if 2, 05 if 5, 13 if 13),  
the value must be made up of the number of rebinds (that are 8 bits for each one),  
plus one for the final 8 bits.  
For example, if we want to rebind 4 keys, the value number of rebinds will be 05,00,00,00,  
if the rebinds are 12 the value will be 13,00,00,00,

---
What means "rebind n1":  

| 3A,00, | 5D,E0, |
| --- | --- |
| 1st part: it's the keycode of the remapping | 2nd part: keycode of the button you actually press

[<img src="https://i.ibb.co/h7hwpbn/Empty-png.png" width="1"/>](https://github.com/Lamer87/Space_Engineers_DLC_unlocker#space-engineers-dlc-unlocker)
---
What means a single code like "5D,EO":  

5D: scancode of the key  
E0: can be 00 or E0 (or E1 for button Pause)  
    some keys share the scancode, changing only this second part.

üìú This is an example with 3 rebinds (do not use!):
```
"Scancode Map"=hex:00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,04,00,00,00,3A,00,5D,E0,3E,00,46,00,3F,00,45,E1,00,00,00,00
                  |  version  |   flag    |reb. number| 1st rebind| 2nd rebind| 3rd rebind| null bits |
                                                      | these 4 lines count for the number of rebinds |
```

üìú Just for a better view (do not use!)
```
"Scancode Map"=hex:
00,00,00,00,    version
00,00,00,00,    flag
04,00,00,00,    number of rebinds +1
3A,00,5D,E0,    rebind n1   --\
3E,00,46,00,    rebind n2      \
3F,00,45,E1,    rebind n3      / these 4 lines count towards the total number of rebinds (even final bits)
00,00,00,00     final bits  --/
```

## üìå Key ScanCode table:  
### the secondary code is always "00" when there are only 2 digits in "Code",  
### otherwise it's specified.

These other keys need to be tested, they may not work properly:
| Key | Function |
| --- | --- |
| |
| 5E-E0 | Power
| 5F-E0 | Sleep
| 63-E0 | Wake
| 54 | Alt+SysRq
| FF | non-US-1

Note 1: other keys (like JIS layout) don't work if you don't have the right language set to Windows (like japanase).
Note 2: the vertical bar `|` cannot be included in the table, because it's used to generate it.

- `v1.1` added JIS layout key codes.
- `v1.2` added other functions key codes.

- üïπÔ∏è A good tool to show scancodes for your keyboard is [Keyboard Key Info](https://dennisbabkin.com/kbdkeyinfo/)  
it shows what keycode (1st part) are you pressing on the keyboard.  
Example: "ScanCode=0x4F" where the keycode 1st part is "4F" but you don't know if the second part is 00 or E0,  
so just take a look at the table when needed.
