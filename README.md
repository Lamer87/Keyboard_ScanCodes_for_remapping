## [Keyboard ScanCodes for remapping ‚å®Ô∏è](https://github.com/Lamer87/Keyboard_ScanCodes_for_remapping#keyboard-scancodes-for-remapping-%EF%B8%8F)

### This is a simple guide for remapping (rebinding) keyboard keys
### whitout using a tool, just the system registry (in hexadecimal).

`v1.4` - For ISO, ANSI and JIS layouts.

- [**üìå Key ScanCode TABLE**](https://github.com/Lamer87/Keyboard_ScanCodes_for_remapping#-key-scancode-table) (go directly to)

- ‚ÄºÔ∏è This is only for changing one key to another, it is NOT possible to map combinations  
(example CTRL+C) to a key, to do this you need a tool like AutoHotKey.

- üí° You can find [other sources and tools](https://github.com/Lamer87/Keyboard_ScanCodes_for_remapping#-other-sources) at the bottom of this page.

---

- üíæ You can download the package (readme, example and remover) [here üíæ](https://github.com/Lamer87/Keyboard_ScanCodes_for_remapping/archive/refs/heads/main.zip),  
or just click on "Code" then "Download ZIP".

  - The EXAMPLE file (Rebind.reg) it's meant to be edited by you.  
This file is ALREADY modified and will add the necessary "hex" value to the registry,  
so before applying it you have to EDIT IT properly.

  - If you want to get rid of the remapping, use the file "remover.reg",  
it can be even used to create just the empty hex value.

  - Every time you apply the values, you must AT LEAST logout and login (or restart), for the changes to take effect.

---

- üìú How to manually create the value in the registry:  
  - 1- Open "C:\Windows\regedit.exe"  
  - 2- Go to "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Keyboard Layout" (not \Keyboard Layout**S**)  
  - 3- Create a new "binary value" here, named "Scancode Map" (without quotes).

- ‚úîÔ∏è What goes inside the binary value is described below in the regedit file format,
so you don't have to manually enter values via regedit.exe, but just modify Rebind.reg then exec it.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Example: ##

```
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Keyboard Layout]
"Scancode Map"=hex:00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,02,00,00,00,3A,00,5D,E0,00,00,00,00
```

What means an entire regedit code:  

| 00,00,00,00, | 00,00,00,00, | 02,00,00,00, | 3A,00,5D,E0, | 00,00,00,00 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1st 8 bits | 2nd 8 bits | 3rd 8 bits | 4th 8 bits | 5th 8 bits
| version | flag | number of rebinds +1! | rebind n1 | final bits (null)

Each PAIR of zeroes is separated by a "," except for the last pair which ends without it.

Version: always 8 zeroes.  
Flag: always 8 zeroes.  
Final bits: always 8 zeroes.

Number of rebinds:  
only the first 2 bits count as a number (examples: 02 if 2, 05 if 5, 13 if 13),  
the value must be made up of the number of rebinds (that are 8 bits for each one),  
plus one for the final 8 bits.  
For example, if we want to rebind 4 keys, the value number of rebinds will be 05,00,00,00,  
if the rebinds are 12 the value will be 13,00,00,00,

---
What means "rebind n1":  

| 3A,00, | 5D,E0, |
| --- | --- |
| 1st part: it's the keycode of the remapping | 2nd part: keycode of the button you actually press

[<img src="https://i.ibb.co/h7hwpbn/Empty-png.png" width="1"/>](https://github.com/Lamer87/Keyboard_ScanCodes_for_remapping#keyboard-scancodes-for-remapping-%EF%B8%8F)
---
What means a single code like "`5D,EO`":  

`5D`: this first couple it's the scancode of the key.  
`E0`: this second couple can be 00 or E0; some keys share the scancode (first couple), changing only this part.

---
üìú This is an example with 3 rebinds (do not use in a reg file!):
```
"Scancode Map"=hex:00,00,00,00,00,00,00,00,04,00,00,00,3A,00,5D,E0,3E,00,46,00,3F,00,45,E0,00,00,00,00
                  |  version  |   flag    |reb. number| 1st rebind| 2nd rebind| 3rd rebind| null bits |
                                                      | these 4 lines count for the number of rebinds |
```

---
üìú Just for a better view (do not use in a reg file!)
```
"Scancode Map"=hex:
00,00,00,00,    version
00,00,00,00,    flag
04,00,00,00,    number of rebinds +1
3A,00,5D,E0,    rebind n1   --\
3E,00,46,00,    rebind n2      \
3F,00,45,E0,    rebind n3      / these 4 lines count towards the total number of rebinds (even final bits)
00,00,00,00     final bits  --/
```

## üìå Key ScanCode table:  
### the secondary code is always "00" when there are only 2 digits in "Code",  
### otherwise it's specified !

- Note 1: "**Pause**" button can't be used/remapped because it's a multiple bits hex (need a tool like AutoHotKey).
- Note 2: other keys (like JIS) may not work if you haven't set the correct language (japanase) to Windows.

  - `v1.1` added JIS layout key codes.
  - `v1.2` added other functions key codes.
  - `v1.3` Corrected button "Pause"; can't be used or remapped without a tool like AutoHotKey.
  - `v1.4` added other functions key codes.

- üïπÔ∏è A good tool to **show scancodes** of your keyboard is [Keyboard Key Info](https://dennisbabkin.com/kbdkeyinfo/),  
it shows what keycode are you pressing on the keyboard (1st part only).  
Example: "ScanCode=0x4F" where the keycode 1st part is "4F" but you don't know if the second part is 00 or E0,  
so just take a look at the table when needed.

- üïπÔ∏è Another good one is [SharpKeys tool](https://github.com/randyrants/sharpkeys),  
uses the **same method** as this guide (regedit hex) but with a graphical interface.  
Remember, do NOT to use the "Pause" button! the tool recognizes it, but then it doesn't work either way:  
when "Pause" is used to press another key, or when another key is used to press "Pause".
